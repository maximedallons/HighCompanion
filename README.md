Management app for weed addicts.

I have a friend which was highly addicted to weed and I once asked him how many joints he smoked a day and he couldn't answer me.

I then pitched the idea of creating a mobile to help him track the number of joints he smoked a day in order to regulate it and slowly reduce his addiction.
